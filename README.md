# TermKeep

TermKeep is a self-hosted, zero-knowledge password vault built for the Linux terminal.
It combines a Go CLI/TUI, offline-first encrypted storage, and a multi-account Go server.

> [!WARNING]
> TermKeep is currently in the design phase. Do not use it to store real credentials yet.

## MVP direction

- Linux-only CLI/TUI and per-terminal session agent
- Email and master-password accounts with OPAQUE authentication
- Client-side encryption and a server that stores only encrypted vault blobs
- Offline unlock, editing, fuzzy search, and eventual synchronization
- Login items, secure notes, folders, favorites, custom fields, and TOTP generation
- Bitwarden, 1Password, and generic CSV imports
- Password generation and optional Pwned Passwords checks
- Multi-account self-hosting with PostgreSQL, Traefik, and Docker Compose

## Terminal sessions

Login starts a Linux session agent scoped to the current shell and TTY:

```sh
termkeep login --email user@example.com
```

Later logins from that terminal reuse the unlocked session. Another terminal
must authenticate separately. Auto-lock defaults to 15 minutes and can be
selected when creating the session:

```sh
termkeep login --email user@example.com --auto-lock 30
termkeep login --email user@example.com --auto-lock off
```

Values from 1 through 60 are minutes. To change an active session's setting,
log out and create it again. `termkeep logout` clears the current terminal's
unlocked material and removes its local socket. Closing the owning shell or
reaching the inactivity timeout does the same automatically.

The agent restricts its Unix socket to the current OS user, checks peer
credentials, disables core dumps, and memory-locks and clears key material on
a best-effort basis. These measures do not protect against root or a
compromised client host.
